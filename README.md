# Assignment 

A Remote.co is working on getting their product to market. They have developed a web app using the latest technologies. 

They have a **Frontend App** (Built using NuxtJS) and a **Backend App** (Built using Node JS).

They also have an [NGINX](https://acuments.com/how-to-setup-openresty-to-auto-generate-ssl-certs.html) to load balance the request and allow customers to use custom domains with the app. 

Your job is to prepare a deployment plan for [Remote.co](http://Remote.co). Figure out how this Web app can be deployed. Remote.co has an AWS account and they are open to using AWS ECS to deploy the application.

[Remote.co](http://Remote.co) is expecting you to make 

1. Architecture diagrams.
2. Deployment Diagrams.
3. Application Security Check.
4. Monitoring and Logging stack.
5. CI/CD pipelines. 
6. etc..

Since they arenâ€™t the experts here, so you will have to **prepare documentation of what needs to be done and how it will be done.**

Can you help them deploy their Web App?
